    <h1>Dying for a Selfie</h1>

    <p>Most of us have taken a selfie at one time or another, be it a photo of ourselves in a beautiful place, during a performance by our favourite band, or a memorable night out with friends. But today, more and more people are putting their lives at risk in an attempt to get the most shocking pictures to share on social media. In several cases, this action has had disastrous consequence.
	</p>

    <p>Take, for example, the Spaniard who was killed by a bull when he was taking a selfie during the annual bull run in a village near his hometown, or the Singaporean tourist who died when he fell from cliffs on the coast of Bali. Such incidents have led to death toll from selfie-related incidents reaching double figures for the first time in 2015, overtaking the number of victims of shark attacks.
	</p>

    <p>Despite the risk, social media is full of pictures featuring near misses that could have been fatal under other circumstances. Under the caption "Most dangerous selfie ever", a woman posing at a stadium can be seen as narrowly avoiding being hit in the head by a baseball approaching her. Yet the photo has received thousands of 'likes', and the comments below it suggest that this behaviour is something to be admired.
	</p>

    <p>In response to the increasing threat posed by the selfie, the authorities have started to tae action. The Russian Interior Ministry, for instance, has launched a public education campaign advising selfie-takers against balancing on dangerous surfaces or posing with their pets, among other things. But if instructions like this are really necessary, then perhaps it is about time we asked ourselves which is more important, a 'like' or a life?
